# 🧹📊 Python Data Manipulation with Pandas & co: Cleaning, EDA, Analysis, Visualization Projects

Welcome to the **Python Data Cleaning, EDA, Analysis & Visualization Repository**!  
This repository brings together a curated collection of hands-on projects demonstrating how to clean, explore, analyze, and visualize data using Python and the Pandas library.

---

## 🚀 Repository Highlights

- **Multiple Projects:** Each folder contains a standalone project focused on a specific data skill.
- **Skill-Focused:** All examples utilize Python and Pandas, often with Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for visualization.
- **Step-by-Step Notebooks:** Easy-to-follow code and documentation for learning and reference.
- **Real Datasets:** Business, finance, marketing, and more.

Each project folder includes:
- A dedicated README describing the project
- A Jupyter Notebook or script with annotated code
- A Dataset in the form of csv or xls file that needs to be copied in the same folder as the Jupyter notebook so this one extracts the data properly
