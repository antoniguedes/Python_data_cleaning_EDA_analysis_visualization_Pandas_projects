# 🧹📊 Python Data Manipulation with Pandas & co: Cleaning, EDA, Analysis, Visualization Projects

- This repository brings together a collection of hands-on projects demonstrating how to clean, explore, analyze, and visualize data using Python and the Pandas library.
- It is here to showcase my abilities in Python as a Data Analyst for potential employers.
- Whether you’re learning data cleaning for the first time or looking for reusable code snippets and project inspiration, this repo can be a practical, skill-focused resource for Python data projects.

## 🚀 Repository Highlights

- **Multiple Projects:** Each folder contains a standalone project focused on a specific data skill.
- **Skill-Focused:** All examples utilize Python and Pandas, often with Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for visualization.
- **Step-by-Step Notebooks:** Easy-to-follow code and documentation for learning and reference.

Each project folder includes:
- A dedicated README describing the project
- A Jupyter Notebook or script with annotated code
- A Dataset in the form of csv or xls file that needs to be copied in the same folder as the Jupyter notebook so this one extracts the data properly
